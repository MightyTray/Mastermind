Link to Code:
https://replit.com/@MaitreyaDas1/Term-Project#TermProject.js

To Run Game:
1) Go to link above
2) On Right hand side of webpage, there should be a green button "Fork"
3) Click the "Fork" button
4) It may ask you to sign up to repl, doing it with gmail should take just a click or two
5) You should know have your copy of the code and should be able to run it

Sorry for the inconveniencd. I tried to see if I could just share a link where you can play the game,
but it said I had to Deploy the project which requires getting a premium repl account which I would have to pay for.
